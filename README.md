# Accident
Road Accident Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Problem Statement:
Road accidents are a leading cause of fatalities and severe injuries worldwide. Delays in detecting accidents and alerting emergency services can significantly increase the risk of death and complications for the victims. Traditional monitoring systems often rely on human observation, which can be slow and prone to error.

Solution:
To address this critical issue, we have developed a system that leverages CNNs to automatically detect road accidents from traffic camera feeds and instantly alert nearby police stations.

How It Works:
Real-Time Monitoring: Our system continuously analyzes video feeds from traffic cameras using advanced CNN algorithms.
Accurate Detection: By training our model on diverse datasets of traffic incidents, we've achieved high accuracy in identifying genuine accidents, minimizing false alarms.
Immediate Alerts: Once an accident is detected, the system sends an instant notification to the nearest police station, including details and location of the incident.
Scalability and Integration: The solution is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing traffic surveillance infrastructure, making it scalable across various cities and regions.

Impact: This project aims to dramatically reduce response times to road accidents, thereby decreasing the likelihood of fatalities and severe injuries. By automating the detection process, we ensure a swift and efficient emergency response, ultimately creating safer roads for everyone.
